My Journey as a Web Developer
My Name is Aremu Emmanuel. I am a year 2 student of Economics at the Federal University of Port Harcourt (UNIPORT). I suddenly found passion in tech and am wielding two careers as a Tech Economist.
It was a quiet Saturday evening, around 7:46 PM WAT on October 13, 2025, when I decided to chase a passion, I’d long ignored. Sitting at my desk with a plate of Garri and some groundnuts (which was my rescue when the Nigerian known enemy “SAPA” came knocking). I opened Visual Studio Code and typed my first <h1> into an index.html file: "Game Vault." Seeing it appear in my browser felt like unlocking a secret door. That moment marked the start of my web development journey—a path I didn’t know would become my passion.
I began with the basics, building a "HTML Gaming Platform" page to share gaming info, complete with an image of a gamer and a few links. My code was rough, and I struggled with closing tags, but each fix was a victory. Next, I tackled List.html, creating a to-do list with checkboxes for "Sleep," "Eat Healthy," and "Learn HTML." Checking off those tasks as I coded them gave me a thrill—it was like building my own productivity tool.
Then came forms.html. I designed fields for names, ages, and a dropdown with countries like Australia and Nigeria, adding a text area where I proudly typed "My name is Oluwaseyi." It was personal, and it made the page mine. TABLES.html followed, where I organized days and numbers into neat rows—a challenge that tested my patience but paid off when it rendered perfectly. My Gaming.html page evolved into a platform intro, blending my love for games with newfound skills.
As I grew bolder, I explored more. How to surf.html let me experiment with step-by-step guides, while About Me.html became a canvas to share my story, and Contact.html added a form for feedback. Each page was a puzzle—sometimes the CSS wouldn’t load, or a tag would break—but every error (bug) taught me resilience. Late nights turned into early mornings, my laptop glowing as I debugged and refined.
Looking back, that first <h1> has grown into a collection of pages reflecting my progress. I’m still a beginner, but this journey—started on a whim—has shown me the power of persistence. There’s a world of code ahead, and I’m just getting started.
